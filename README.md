## PeelHealthAutomatedSolutions
A [Java] based automated solution for various [Peel-Health] site navigation functionalities utilising [Selenium] in conjunction with [TestNG] framework. The build environment has been locally set to [Maven]. A page-object-model design has been explored where the test classes invoke various DSL(Domain Specific Language) wrapped methods from the page objects. 

Note:
- Debug logs are disabled in logback-test.xml
- For older versions of Mozilla, some navigation links may not work as they have not been updated.
